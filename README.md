**What makes Echo Global Logistics, a Chicago-based, technology-enabled, industry-leader great?**

For starters, everything has been up at Echo this year – revenue, profits, share price, hiring, and retention!  In addition, IT employees rave about the open culture. Employees are free to attend quarterly meetings where management is transparent, as are company results; the team feels listened to and empowered; leadership routinely acts on suggestions made by employees. 

Echo is the true embodiment of a collaborative environment, complete with competitive compensation, a progressive technology stack, training opportunities, dedicated agile space, company outings, bi-weekly team lunches, unlimited caffeination and hydration, hackathon participation, Movember contest, beer Fridays, bag tournaments, softball teams, charitable giving, etc.

But things are not all fun and games. When it is crunch time, it is all hands on deck, from entry level to senior management. Bottom line, everyone is in it together, working as a team.  

Who better to share why Echo is great than members of the IT team….

“Echo is smart, young, energetic, creative and fast-paced. I’m consistently impressed with the existing team’s desire and ability to seek out and implement change. Outside of IT proper there are a bunch of nice touches. Echo is a very charitable environment, offering a number of ways to give and get involved. IT caters in lunch a couple times a month. Lastly, the on-site gym (not free, but discounted and convenient) is a huge benefit.”— **Senior UX Designer**

“Since working at Echo, I’ve had a better work/life balance because we do a good job planning projects, which leads to a consistent work schedule. We are very collaborative across development teams, support learning and share ideas.” — **Team Lead**

“Echo is a technology-focused company set at disrupting one of the oldest industries. With technology at its core, and a rapid growth pattern, you can imagine…there is significant opportunity for talented individuals to come on board and make an immediate impact.” — **Senior Developer**

“Echo’s IT group has created an excellent—and creative—environment. Additionally, members of the group have forged long lasting friendships and relationships which have resulted in a talented workforce that is fun and rewarding to be a part of.” — **Integrations Manager**

“Echo is a company that empowers its employees by making a large organization feel like a small company.”—Software Development Manager

“Echo IT is an energetic, collaborative environment that strives for innovative solutions to complex business and technological problems. Employees work in cross functional teams to deliver software products that are utilized as a competitive advantage for Echo in the transportation industry.” — **IT Product Manager**

The future at Echo is bright and opportunities for members of its IT team, much like its revenue, profits, share price, hiring, and retention, continue to be on the rise!
